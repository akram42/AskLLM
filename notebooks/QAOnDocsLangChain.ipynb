      "\n",
      "active-duty military personnel, or are institutionalized (i.e., in jails or hospitals). This limitation means that those \n",

      "individuals who have a mental illness who are also experiencing homelessness or are incarcerated are not \n",

      "represented in the data presented by the NSDUH. If the data did include individuals who were experiencing \n",
